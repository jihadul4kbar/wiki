# Delete Page Button Plugin for DokuWiki

The plugin adds a _Delete page_ button to DokuWiki's 
[PageMenu](https://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:menus).

This provides a simpler, quicker and more intuitive way for users to 
delete wiki pages, compared to the 
[documented page deletion method](https://www.dokuwiki.org/page#delete_a_page).

I first thought I could adapt 
[this old plugin](https://github.com/caillou/dokuwiki-plugin-delete)
but I ended up restarting from scratch.
